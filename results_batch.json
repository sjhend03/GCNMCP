GRB 070318: Optical/IR afterglow observations were made using the ANDICAM instrument on a 1.3m telescope at CTIO. The afterglow was detected in the first epoch images but faded between the first and second epochs. The decay rate (afterglow flux proportional to t^-alpha) was found to be alpha ~ 0.3.\\n\\n2.
