In the first 1340 second  \nstack, the IR source noted by Castro-Tirado et al. (GCN 6968/6971) is  \nnot detected to J=18.35 mag, H=16.87 mag, Ks=16.43 (2.5 sigma upper  \nlimit). This is not particularly constraining in light of the deep  \nSubaru imaging (Terada et al. GCN 6976) at a similar epoch.\n\n  We note that despite the z-band detection (Malesani et al. GCN  \n#6972) the very high-redshift hypothesis of Sakamoto et al. (GCN  \n6967) is not yet ruled out. In particular, in high z QSO spectra  \nthere can be some transmitted flux (in the z-band filter  \ntransmission) through the Lyman-alpha forest between ~8000 Ang and  \n8500 Ang (see, e.g., Fan et al. 2006 **) for z > 6.3 sources. So long  \nas the redshifted Lyman limit at the redshift of the emitting source  \nis blueward of ~8500 Ang, this light would not be entirely  \nsuppressed. This consideration yields an upper limit:\n\n                         (1 + z_GRB)*912 Ang < 8500 Ang\n                                     z_GRB <~ 8.3\n\n  At such redshifts, say z_GRB = 8, all reported long-wavelength  \nobservations to-date would be naturally accommodated:\n\n  - the deep non-detections at R and i-band (Berger & Covarrubias,  \nGCNs 6973,6974), being blueward of 912*[1+z_GRB])\n   - the faint detection at z-band (GCN 6972) due transmitted flux  \nbetween 912*[1+z_GRB] = 8200 and 8500 Ang is allowed (as above)\n   - the afterglow detections at H and K (GCN 6968; Terada et al. GCN  \n6976)\n   - the apparent faintness of J-band flux (GCN 6968) relative to H  \nand K given the Gunn-Peterson trough would extend to (1 + z_GRB)*1216  \nAng =~ 1.1 micron.\n\n  All of this assumes that the z-band source is not a foreground  \ngalaxy (in which case a higher-z GRB suggested by Castro-Tirado et  \nal. is allowed).  If indeed the GRB originated from z > 7, we would  \nexpect to see what would resemble emission lines between lam_obs =  \n912*[1+z_GRB] and ~8500 Ang, motivating the utility of *optical*  \nspectroscopy of this source. Even without spectroscopy, when final  \nmagnitudes are reported along with filter transmission curves, a full  \nSED should be illuminating."\n\nThis message may be cited.\n\n(*)  http://pairitel.org\n(**) http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/ \nv132n1/205115/205115.web.pdf'}}, {'llm_z': 5.0, 'actual_z': 2.452, 'event_id': '071021', 'relevent_file_content': {'subject': 'GRB 071021: R-band detection and analysis', 'body': "S.

A nanomaggie is a flux-density unit\nequal to 10^-9 of a magnitude 0 source or, to the extent that\nSDSS is an AB system, 3.631e-6 Jy.  The FITS images have WCS\nastrometric information.\n\nIn the file GRB080330_sdss.calstar.dat, we report photometry\nand astrometry of 219 bright stars (r<20.5) within 15' of the\nburst location.  The magnitudes presented in this file are asinh\nmagnitudes as are standard in the SDSS (Lupton 1999, AJ, 118,\n1406). Beware that some of these stars are not well-detected\nin the u-band; use the errors and object flags to monitor\ndata quality.\n\nIn the files GRB080330_sdss.objects_flux.dat and\nGRB080330_sdss.objects_magnitudes.dat, we report photometry\nof 1512 objects detected within 6' of the GRB position.\nWe have removed saturated objects and objects with model\nmagnitudes fainter than 23.0 in the r-band.  The fluxes listed\nin GRB080330_sdss.objects_flux.dat are in nanomaggies while\nthe magnitudes listed in GRB080330_sdss.objects_magnitudes.dat\nare asinh magnitudes.\n\n\nAll quantities reported are standard SDSS photometry, meaning\nthat they are very close to AB zeropoints and magnitudes are\nquoted in asinh magnitudes.  Photometric zeropoints are known\nto about 2% rms.  None of the photometry is corrected for\ndust extinction.  The Schlegel, Finkbeiner, and Davis (1998)\npredictions for this region are A_U=0.082 mag, A_g=0.060 mag,\nA_r = 0.044 mag, A_i=0.033 mag, and A_z=0.023 mag.\n\nThe file GRB080330_sdss.spectro.dat contains a list of the\n2 objects with SDSS spectroscopy within 6 arcminutes of the\nGRB position.  In addition to the redshift and 1-sigma error\nfor each object, this file also lists the object spectroscopic\nclassification.\n\n\nSDSS astrometry is generally better than 0.1 arcsecond per\ncoordinate.  Users requiring high precision astrometry should\ntake note that the SDSS astrometric system can differ from\nother systems such as those used in other notices; we have\nnot checked the offsets in this region.\n\nMore detailed information pertaining to our SDSS GRB releases\ncan be found in our initial data release paper (Cool et\nal. 2006, PASP 118, 733).  See the SDSS DR4 documentation for\nmore details: http://www.sdss.org/dr5.\n\nThese data have been reduced using a slightly different\npipeline than that used for SDSS public data releases.\nWe cannot guarantee that the values here will exactly match\nthose in the data release in which these data are included.\nIn particular, we expect the photometric calibrations to differ\nby of order 0.01 mag.\n\nThis note may be cited, but please also cite the SDSS data\nrelease paper, Adelman-McCarthy et al. (2007, ApJS, 172, 634),\nwhen using the data or referring to the technical documentation."}}]
